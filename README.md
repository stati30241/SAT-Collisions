# SAT-Collisions

A simple program that showcases the SAT Collision Detection and Resolution Algorithm. It allows for the detection of collision between any convex polygon and works well with objects that are moving.

Controls:
- Drag the polygons around using your mouse
- Move the red polygon around using the WASD keys
- Rotate the red polygon using the Q and E keys
- Change the properties of the red polygon using the menu

(Maybe I'll write about how this algorithm works but its almost midnight rn and I have school tomorrow and I should really be in bed)
